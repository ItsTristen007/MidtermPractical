/*
 *Part 2
 * Toon shaders are meant to make a an object look like it was for a cartoon
 * This is done by instantly changing the diffuse and specular lighting instead of changing it gradually
 * It uses a toon ramp to take a certain shade and transfer it to the object.
 * I used it for the pills and the monsters because it makes the game feel more cartoon like and it fit the theme really well
 *

 *Part 3
 * 
 * The colour correction is used to make the scene and enhance it by changing hue and colours 
 * Here it is used to make the scene look like a hospital by changing the hue seen by the player into cool colours representing hospitals and their lights
 *
 *Part 4
 * What was done:
 * I made a transparent hologram type shader to make the jar see thru this gives the same effect as the original game but making it more modern.
 * The shader takes advantage of the alpha channel which changes the alpha value for the material making it see thru.
 * The code makes a slider to change the alpha value.
